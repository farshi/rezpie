# RezPie - A New Approach to Computing π

## Overview
RezPie is a novel polygon-tangent-based method for computing π with high precision. This repository contains:
- A LaTeX research paper (`rezpie.tex`)
- A compiled PDF (`rezpie.pdf`)
- The Python implementation of RezPie (`rezpie.py`)

## Running the Code
To compute π using RezPie, run:
```
python rezpie.py
```

## Compiling the Paper
To compile the LaTeX paper, use:
```
pdflatex rezpie.tex
```
